(London calling) to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holdin' out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't want to shout
But while we were talking I saw you noddin' out
London calling, see we ain't got no Hyde
'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes
